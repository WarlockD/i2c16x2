#
# On how to use wlcd just type "sudo /home/pi/w16x2lcd" for brief explaination.
#
# Please  note that if you do not have a WiFi connection
# it is not recommended that you put this script to
# .bashrc in your home directory. This may slow down the
# creation of console window.
#
#
# TO INCLUDE THIS SCRIPT in /etc/rc.local or .bashrc of your home directroy.
# Change the absolute path if necessary.
#
# In case of wifi connection during boot up takes up more then
# 15 seconds,  this script will give up waiting. Therefore no IP
# address is shown. However, by initiating a new console window
# .bashrc will be executed again, IP address is shown under the
# condition that there is a established wifi connection.
